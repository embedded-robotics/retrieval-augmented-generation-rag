Symptoms in birds may include sudden death, swollen head, closed and runny eyes, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, and fewer eggs laid. Treatment for bird flu involves staying at home or being treated in the hospital, where antiviral medicines may be given to reduce the severity of the condition and prevent complications. To reduce the risk of bird flu, it is important to wash hands frequently, cook meat thoroughly, avoid contact with live birds, and not consume raw poultry or eggs.\n"
