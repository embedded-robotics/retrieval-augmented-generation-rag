In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to:

Use LangChain to build custom chatbots
Design a chatbot using your understanding of the business requirements and hospital system data
Work with graph databases
Set up a Neo4j AuraDB instance
Build a RAG chatbot that retrieves both structured and unstructured data from Neo4j
Deploy your chatbot with FastAPI and Streamlit

Under the hood, the Streamlit app sends your messages to the chatbot API, and the chatbot generates and sends a response back to the Streamlit app, which displays it to the user.
